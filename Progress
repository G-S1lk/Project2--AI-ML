                            Assignment

A. Create a program that implements a fuzzy logic controller that receives inputs related
to speed and altitude data and controls a hypothetical airplane to increase or decrease
its speed. You will choose the rules to adopt as well as the data set.
B. Create a program that simulates the knapsack problem with a swarm intelligence
algorithm (not a genetic algorithm). Your program should allow the user to enter the
problem data
