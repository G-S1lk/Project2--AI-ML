A. Create a program that implements a fuzzy logic controller that receives inputs related
to speed and altitude data and controls a hypothetical airplane to increase or decrease
its speed. You will choose the rules to adopt as well as the data set.
B. Create a program that simulates the knapsack problem with a swarm intelligence
algorithm (not a genetic algorithm). Your program should allow the user to enter the
problem data

First of all a research on airplanes is needed to have a better understanding and decide how to build the program.I want to have a more realistic approach to the plane,
maybe include the average weight,the type or something that can be distinct.Perhaps the user enters the weight of the plane ,the state of the flight(take-off/landing/crusing),height,speed
and the fuzzy outputs if it should increase,decrease or stay the same.For now I will impliment only the speed and altitude if it's simple I will impliment other aspects.

The average plane goes a maximum speed of 10000 km/h and altitude of 45000 feet

Speed of average plane:0 - 10000 km/h
Altitude of average plane:0 - 45000 feet
